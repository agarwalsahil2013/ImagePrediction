# ImagePrediction

Hello fellas, Nice to see you here. Let me explain the whole project.

## Introduction
This project uses Image Prediction model developed by MobileNetV2. There are more popular model available with higher probabilities i.e. ResNet50 (by Microsoft), InceptionV3 (by Google) and DenseNet121(by Facebook). The reason I have used MobileNet due to the smaller model size as compare to the rest. Other models are great in predicting images. You can find additional model in this repository. Here is a link to know more about **ImageAI**.

## Deployed Model on Heroku
You can test the model on **Heroku** from this [link](https://imagepredictiondeploy.herokuapp.com/). I had fun testing different images and found some images are better predicted by MobileNetV2 compare to everyone else. Please test the model with your desire image. I'm sure you'll enjoy too.
